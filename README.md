# DomainGlass
Mathematical domain lookup + domain lookup via right click extension on Google Chrome using Google's Domain.Glass 

For installation git clone https://github.com/777388/DomainGlass.git

then get into your chrome://extensions and load unpacked the DomainGlass folder in

for usage right click on a page and hit domainglasses for intel on the domain, or highlight some text and hit domainglass and accumulate from it and look at information of the mathematical domain of what you highlighted


This is in a series of BlockChain changes I've been making, where instead of assigning the blockchain to impermable (and I use impermable for a reason) memory addresses which can not be deletedd, the blockchain is accumulated to Domain addresses in a fashion that increases the worth of the Domain.

Future projects concerning this will be based around coming up with words and word combinations that equate out to the accumulation mathematically. Attempts have been made, but it appears there are word blocks on what can be used within a dictionary set for a google extension.
